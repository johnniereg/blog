i'm here for space elevators

i'm here for life on mars

even through it's prescient quarantine vibes

put me in a cube and project all the nature i'm missing

do our issues with our fathers really need to span the universe?

does everything have to be about being good at our job?

the variations in scifi come in the tiny degrees

what if we are alone?
